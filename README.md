This repository is an area for me to practice learning C.

I move between a few computers, so this repository is so I can continue to work between them and between VM's as well.

# H1 The goal of this Repo

I coded a lot of C++ in College, and as I've gotten into Data Science, I've realized I really enjoy low level coding.

I want to make the pivot to embedded/ firmware engineering. So I need a repo to practice that skillset. 

I think some micro projects will come from this and I'll debate on storing them here or in a C_libraries repo (Currently I plan on building a Regex interface and a REST API ingester with libcurl.)

Eventually I'm going to move onto coding with the STM32 boards and some Arduino, but for now I want to focus on getting into Linux Processes.
